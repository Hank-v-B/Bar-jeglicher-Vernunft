### “Bar of No Reason”

**[Verse 1]**  
Friday has a sound, it’s the exhale in the room,  
ties get loosened, truth gets watered down with perfume.  
I’ve seen saints turn shaky when the last round hits the glass,  
seen a harmless little sentence turn a soft night hard and fast.  
So I pour like it’s a craft, keep my eyes where shadows move,  
I don’t judge, I don’t preach— I just measure what they prove.  
And the neon on the bottles is a choir of mistakes,  
singing, *“You can be unwise, but don’t be cruel for cruelty’s sake.”*

**[Chorus]**  
This is the bar of no reason, baby— come in and breathe,  
leave your office war outside, leave your crown, leave your teeth.  
We don’t fix you, we don’t break you, we don’t make you behave,  
we just keep the night from turning into somebody’s grave.  
So raise it slow, not like a weapon— more like a vow,  
we can go a little mad, but we don’t go low. Not now.  

**[Verse 2]**  
Some folks want a fight so they can feel their blood is real,  
some folks want a rule so they can hide behind the deal.  
I’ve seen “fair” used like a hammer, “respect” used like a knife,  
and “sharing” said so sweet it tastes like somebody’s afterlife.  
I wipe the counter like a prayer I never learned to say,  
turn the volume down a hair when the room starts to decay.  
’Cause a crowd is just a fire— warm until it steals the air,  
and I’m paid to keep it glowing, not to watch it burn a chair.

**[Chorus]**  
This is the bar of no reason, baby— come in and breathe,  
leave your office war outside, leave your crown, leave your teeth.  
We don’t fix you, we don’t break you, we don’t make you behave,  
we just keep the night from turning into somebody’s grave.  
So raise it slow, not like a weapon— more like a vow,  
we can go a little mad, but we don’t go low. Not now.  

**[Bridge]**  
I’ve got revolution on tap, but it’s foam, not hate,  
I’ll sell you a chorus before I let you pick a fate.  
If you need an enemy, pick the cheap stuff in your cup,  
if you need a victory— drink water, then stand up.  
I’ve watched men hunt for monsters in the mirror of the crowd,  
but the bravest thing is quiet, and the quiet isn’t loud.  
So if your mouth is full of thunder and your hands don’t know what to do—  
put your hand on the glass, and let the glass cool you too.

**[Verse 3]**  
Last call is not a sentence, it’s a seatbelt in the crash,  
a little bit of mercy for the ones who swing too fast.  
The floor is sticky truth, the laughter’s got a bruise,  
and everybody’s got a story they’re afraid to let them lose.  
I lock the door, the room exhales, the night falls back to still,  
and I’m standing with the silence like an unpaid, stubborn bill.  
Then I think— not proud, not holy— just tired and kind of glad:  
for a few damn hours, nobody had to be alone in being mad.

**[Final Chorus]**  
This is the bar of no reason, baby— come in and breathe,  
leave your office war outside, leave your crown, leave your teeth.  
We don’t fix you, we don’t break you, we don’t make you behave,  
we just keep the night from turning into somebody’s grave.  
So raise it slow, not like a weapon— more like a vow,  
we can go a little mad… but we don’t go low. Not now.  

**[Outro]**  
Tomorrow’s got its silence.  
Tonight we’ve got this song.  
Bar of no reason—  
and somehow… we get along.
